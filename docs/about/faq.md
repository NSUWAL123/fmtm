# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions ❓

## General

**Q:** What is the Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM)?

**A:** The Field Mapping Tasking Manager (FMTM) is an online platform that
allows contributors to participate in mapping projects related to
humanitarian and development work.

---

**Q:**: What problem does it solve?

**A:** There are a few great tools for adding tags to OpenStreetMap in the field
already. FMTM is not aiming to compete with these tools, but instead has two goals:

1. To solve the challenge of effectively coordinating mappers to work together
   when mapping an entire area of interest. It can be difficult to **subdivide tasks**
   and know **who is working on what tasks.**. FMTM should solve this problem.

2. Allow for coordinated field mapping outside of OpenStreetMap. Sometimes
   OpenStreetMap is not an appropriate target for the collected data, so a data
   flow outside of this ecosystem should be possible too.

**Q:**: Don't other tools do similar things?

**A:**

!!! note

      The following is the personal opinion from HOT staff members, and provides
      some context for the reasoning behind creating the FMTM.

- _Fulcrum_: proprietary / paid. Appears to be more focused on data collection in
  engineering and environmental contexts, mostly for for-profit companies.
  We could possibly learn from them, but they are closed-source.

- _ArcGIS Field Maps_: proprietary / paid, similar applications to Fulcrum, but not
  necessarily designed for text/question based surveys.

- _ArcGIS Survey123_: proprietary / paid, more appropriate for our use case of field
  survey data collection. However, not an option due to it's closed nature.

- _KoboCollect_: fork of ODK, same mobile app essentially, but different back end.
  Has a slightly complicated relationship with ODK, formerly taking from the
  community and not giving back. However, they now contribute financially to ODK,
  and definitely have some great ideas in this field. In our opinion, ODK is more
  innovative in pushing field data collection forward though. Kobo do provide a
  free public server backed by the UN, as a general public good, and is widely
  adopted as a result.

- _Ona_: proprietary software, with a slightly shady history of building open-source
  tools using NGO money, then changing the license to a closed model. Were legally
  forced to open-source the original work done, but everything since has been closed.
  Have since done some great work around data management and analytics, however,
  their main objective is not the same as FMTM: coordinating field mapping.

- _MapCampaigner_: a now dead project. In our opinion, this tool certainly helped
  the Monitoring & Evaluation team for field data collection projects, but did not
  add anything innovative in terms of user experience for the the field mapper.

- _POSM_ (+ OpenMapKit): a now dead project. However, this was an excellent technical
  advancement and concept for the open mapping sector. It was arguably the first
  good solution for field mobile data collection (using ODK and other tools
  underneath). OpenMapKit was the data collection system, while POSM was the offline
  server supporting it in the field. Unfortunately, the architecture around this
  was poorly designed, making it difficult to maintain into the future, meaning
  the project failed between 2014-2017.

  !!! note

        The gap left by this only started to be filled with the advent of the
        'Select From Map' functionality in ODK in 2018 (partly originally written
        by Ping @ ODK, with support from HOT and Ramani Huria @ OMDTZ).

        It is still useful to learn from the legacy of this tool around offline
        deployment on a small field-based device (e.g. RaspberryPI), and is
        currently in our roadmap to explore this approach further.

- _CommCare_: technically open-source, developed by Dimagi, but built in such a way
  to make it quite difficult to self-host. Very good at collection of "longitudinal
  data" (data over time), which ODK has only recently began to address with Entities.
  We should definitely look for opportunities to learn from / collaborate into the
  future.

**Q:**: What is the relationship between FMTM and Kobo?

**A:**:

- Kobo is not an FMTM competitor, it's an ODK competitor.
- FMTM uses ODK underneath for reasons explained above, but due to the popularity
  of Kobo, could (and should) probably support the Kobo data collection app going
  forward.
- This does raise challenges, as new features integrated in ODK Collect take approx
  3 months to be integrated into KoboCollect.

  !!! note

        The adoption barrier for migrating from KoboCollect to ODK Collect should
        be minimal due to KoboCollect essentially being a re-branded version of
        ODK.

- Kobo does provide a free data collection server, supported by UN OCHA, meaning
  Kobo adoption in developing countries is currently a lot higher.

  !!! note

        HOT also aims to provide am equivalent free ODK data collection server:
        [https://odk.hotosm.org](https://odk.hotosm.org)

- The Kobo backend is currently (2024) a Python application based on the original
  ODK Aggregate backend of ODK. The Kobo backend became much better than ODK's over
  time. However, ODK have since completely overhauled their backend to a Node server
  called ODK Collect, which is rock-solid and much more advanced than the competition.
- The Kobo web-based form builder is still a big differentiator between the tools,
  as it is much more user-friendly (less technical) than ODK's requirement to know
  XLSForm language. However the capability of the web form builder is much less
  sophisticated than directly using XLSForms. It's nevertheless very useful for
  beginners.

## For Users

**Q:** Do I need to create an account to use the FMTM Web App?

**A:** Mappers have no requirement to sign up, easing the process of mapping
for those that are impatient to get started! However, to use the FMTM project
management site it is recommended to sign in with OSM. This is so data uploaded
to OSM can be attributed to a user. Notifications are also sent via OpenStreetMap
messages/emails.
