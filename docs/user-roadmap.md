<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

| In Progress | Next | Future |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ |
|
| 🚀 As a mapper, I can have live mapping updates when online or can work entirely offline, for maximum flexibility. | 🗺️ As a mapper, I can easily download offline basemaps so I can navigate without connectivity. | 📻 As a project manager, I can deploy FMTM on a small field-based device in environments with connectivity restrictions. |
|
| 🎨 As a project manager, I have a standard/advanced project creation workflow, depending on my preferences and familiarity with the tools. | 🌍 As a project manager, I can export (+merge) the final data to OpenStreetMap to make it accessible. | 📱 As software developers, we will continue to collaborate with ODK to improve the experience in ODK Collect. |
|
| 🔗 As I mapper, I can open ODK Collect directly from FMTM, with a feature pre-selected, speeding up my workflow. | 🪓 As a project manager, I expect and reliable and configurable task splitting algorithm. | 📖 All users of FMTM have up to date documentation and tutortials for each step. |
|
| |🔒 As a project manager, I need to manage various additional user roles (validator, field admin) to ensure my project runs smoothly. | |
